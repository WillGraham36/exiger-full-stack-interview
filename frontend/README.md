# App Dev Club â€“ Frontend Interview 

## Getting started

- Move to the frontend folder with `cd frontend`
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Run the app with `npm run dev`, then go to `http://localhost:3000` to see it
- Edit your code in `src/app/page.tsx`

## Main Tasks

1. **Create the movies app frontend**
- Users should be able to create a movie with 3 inputs for title, director, and year.
- Then there will be a submit button that will create the movie 

- When the app loads, it should fetch the movies from the database and render them in a list
   

## Notes

- Focus on getting the **core functionality** working first, while creating clean, readable code
- Don't worry about styling unless asked to
- Walk us through your thought process as you go, we want to understand how you approach problems, not just see the final result
